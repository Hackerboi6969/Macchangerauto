# Macchangerauto
Great and easy to use mac-changer for any one wanting to change their mac with one command.

## Usage
Just do `./macchanger.py` within repo directory. If you want to use it from anywhere, do `mv macchanger.py ~/bin/macchanger.py` and make sure you add `~/bin` to your PATH.

### Help
If there is the "Could not set network down" then check if your connected to you WiFi or use the toggle `./macchanger -e or --eth0`

If you use a different interface than wlan0 or eth0 then use `-i interface`
